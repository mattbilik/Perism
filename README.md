# Streamlining the online learning process

### Our platform recommends an individualized curriculum in your areas of interest, combining both modularized segments and complete course options, and ensuring effective, optimized mastery.

### Perism leverages a machine learning algorithm, third-party APIs, and a learning style diagnostic to serve as an online course aggregator, removing redundant information based on prior data from machine analysis of the user and the initial diagnostic.
